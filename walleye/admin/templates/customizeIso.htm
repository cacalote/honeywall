					The roo ISO not only serves as a boot-time installation medium, but
					also contains in itself the seeds for a development environment
					that allows one to customize the ISO and re-create their own ISO.
					All you need is the ISO in order to set up a Fedora Core 3 system
					to act as an ISO "factory" to produce more ISOs, but this time
					customized specifically for your site.
					<p>
                    For detailed information about customizing an iso, please refer to the 
                 <a href="http://www.honeynet.org/tools/cdrom/roo/manual/">Online User's Manual</a>.
