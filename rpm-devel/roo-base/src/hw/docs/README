PURPOSE:
========
The Honeywall bootable CD-ROM makes deploying honeynets easier as well as 
standardized.  It accomplishes this by automating the process of creating 
a honeynet gateway, also known as a honeywall.  The honeywall is the most 
critical and complex element to any successful honeynet deployment.  Its 
purpose is to both capture and control all inbound and outbound honeynet 
traffic.  In the past, building a honeywall was a difficult and a manually 
intensive process, requiring the combination of various technologies.  We 
have attempted to combine all of these elements into a single, bootable 
CD-ROM.  This provides the user a bootable gateway from this CD-ROM. After 
the initial boot, some configuration will be required in order for the 
system to be fully functional.  Before proceeding, it is critical that 
you first understand the concepts, technologies, and RISKS invovled with 
deploying a honeynet.  As such, you need to first read and understand all
