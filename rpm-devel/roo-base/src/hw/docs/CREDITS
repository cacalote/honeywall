PURPOSE
=======
To give credit to the individuals and organizations involved in making 
this Honeywall CDROM possible.  The Honeynet Project and Research
Alliance gratefully acknowledge the following individuals and their 
contributions.  This CDROM would not have been possible without their 
efforts.


CORE DEVELOPERS
===============
This is the core group that was dedicated to architecting,
developing, and now maintaining the new Honeywall CDROM Roo.  Without
these folks, we would be dead in the water.  If you ever meet any of
these guys at conference, be sure to by them a beer, you have no idea
how much they have earned it.

ASSISTANT DEVELOPERS
====================
These folks have contributed to the design, development,
and coding of the CDROM.  Often these are the guys
who do all the dirty work, but don't get the recognition.

We would like to thank the following folks for their dedicated time
