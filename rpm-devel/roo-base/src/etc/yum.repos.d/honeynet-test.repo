#
# This is the Honeynet.org Test RPM repo.  
#
# PLEASE BE ADVISED that RPMS from this repo are COMPLETELY
# EXPERIMENTAL and should NOT under any cercumstance be
# used on "production" systems
#
# You have been warned
#
# That being said, The Honeynet Project greatly appreciates
# any feedback from testin of these RPMS.  the more feedback we receive
# the better roo will become...
#
# To enable download of RPMS from this rep there are two choices:
#
# 1. Single use (will only enable install/update from this repo 
#    the single time this method is used:
#  yum --enablerepo=honeynet-test install <insert rpm to install here>
#      (Will install single RPM from test repo - use for new stuff, 
#       not already installed on current system)
#  yum --enablerepo=honeynet-test update 
#      (will update using anything in the test repo found to be newer 
#       than that which is currently installed)
#
# 2. Permanently enabled - This method is only recommended on systems
#    dedicated to testing as it will search the test repo EVERY time 
#    yum is invoked either for new installs of RPMS or for updates.
#    To make this happen simply edit this file, change "enabled=0" 
#    to "enabled=1" and save.  Ther is no need to reboot or restart 
#    any serices.
