# Monit control file
#
# Comments begin with a '#' and extend through the end of the line.
# Blank lines between program entries are ignored. Keywords are case 
# insensitive. All path's MUST BE FULLY QUALIFIED, starting with '/'

# Note to note: Use of leet speek here is to quickly bypass
# a known bug.  I know, I know.  Bad form.  Get over it.

# Note:  If this file appears at some point to be "corrupted" as
# reported by monit, the problem may be a result of improper
# editting of a1ert lines by /dlg/config/Email.pl and/or
# /dlg/config/ChangeEmail.pl, both of which edit this file
# in-situ.  This will likely change soon to use the sendmail
# aliases file, which is the preferred way of directing delivery
# of email.  (E.g., assigning addresses for monit-a1ert@localhost
# and "swatch-a1ert@localhost", being directed through sendmail
# alias lines like this:
#
# swatch-a1ert: root
# monit-a1ert: root
# root: user@some.place.else.net
