Update 19 Feb 2004:

The following issues are soon to disappear, since:

	1) There are now cleaner upstream sources to work with (Debian)
	2) I'm working towards ditching Crypto++ altogether

######

There seems to be some speculation as  to  the  legal  status  of  this
software.

The problem seems to stem from patents, copyrights and licenses in  the
Crypto++ distribution, by Wei Dei.

For more information on the exact issues, please refer to the following
URL:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=153007

The situation with the Fedora release is not as complex however,  since
many of the questionable components are not included, specifically:

The following are not in the archive, so there is no issue:
src/cryptlib/idea.cpp
src/cryptlib/haval.cpp
src/cryptlib/mars.cpp
src/cryptlib/serpent.cpp
src/cryptlib/md5.cpp
src/cryptlib/md5mac.cpp
src/cryptlib/cast.cpp

The following are copyrighted, but have no license:
src/cryptlib/zbits.cpp
src/cryptlib/ztrees.cpp
src/cryptlib/zdeflate.cpp
src/cryptlib/sha.cpp ?

With regards to those last four files, Stephen Zander <gibreel[AT]pobox
.com> is apparently going to approach Wei Dei with regards clearing  up
the "no license" issues. However, I  don't  think  this  is  a  "fatal"
problem at this stage. Hopefully this  will  include  clearing  up  the
implications of section 2 of src/cryptlib/license.txt, which reads:

"2. Users of the software included in this  compilation  agree  to  use
their best efforts to provide Wei Dai with any modifications containing
improvements or extensions  and  hereby  grant  Wei  Dai  a  perpetual,
royalty-free license to use and distribute such modifications under the
terms of this license."

I'm no  GPL/OSS  expert,  but  there  are  some  who  believe  this  is
incompatible with the GPL. Discussions are ongoing, and I will continue
to update this file in future releases with any news.
