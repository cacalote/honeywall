									Sebek is one of the primary tools used to capture the activity
									of an attacker.  It's a client kernel module (or kernel patch)
									installed on the client honeypots.  It then captures the attacker's
									actions on the honeypot, puts that information into special Sebek
									packets, then sends them over the network to be collected by the
									Honeywall.  This option will allow you to configure how the 
									Honeywall handles your sebek packets.  You will be able to tell 
									the firewall how to identify your sebek packets, and you will be 
									able to tell it how to route them.  If you don't know the answers
									to these questions, then ask the person who installed Sebek on the
									client honeypots.
