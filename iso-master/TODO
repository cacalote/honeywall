Build Environment TODO
===============================================================================

o Get per ISO builds working
   Document how to do the DIR structure under "sites"
   Do some loop foo with build_iso

o Determine best way to handle ssh keys, SSL certs, etc etc
   Perhaps a generic file dropper with roo-1.0 file handling as a template
   instead of ONLY handling specific case files

o Add ability to define all variables and config file location on command line
   for mkiso instead of only working with a config file

o Create unpack_iso in "mkiso" (hint: use existing unpack-iso ;P)

o Convert to Python...  anyone willing to lead/help me... Python Gods?


===============================================================================
Roo TODO (Mainly carried over from roo-1.0)
===============================================================================
o Probably need to remove the initialize drive stuff (otherwise
  someone will reformat their hard drive.)

o Add feature to ks.cfg.hwin in %pre section that detects multiple hard
  drives on different buses (e.g., ide and scsi), or on a single bus
  (e.g., sd0 and sd1) and creates partitioning code to handle.  Default
  will be to just do what we do now, otherwise user can select which
  device is used for primary hard drive.  Then %include these commands
  to be run during setup. See:
